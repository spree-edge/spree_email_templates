# Spree Email Templates

Effortlessly customize and manage Spree emails with the Spree Email Templates extension. This extension empowers store administrators to design email templates according to their requirements and control the sending of emails with a simple toggle.

## Features

- **Default Email Templates:** The extension comes with pre-configured default email templates, offering a ready-to-use solution out of the box.
- **Email Template Customization:** Allow administrators to update and customize Spree email templates directly from the admin panel.
- **Activation Toggle:** Provide the ability to enable or disable specific email templates with a simple activation toggle.

## Installation

1. Add this extension to your Gemfile with this line:

    ```ruby
    gem 'spree_email_templates'
    ```

2. Install the gem using Bundler

    ```ruby
    bundle install
    ```

3. Copy & run migrations

    ```ruby
    bundle exec rails g spree_email_templates:install
    ```

4. Restart your server

  If your server was running, restart it so that it can find the assets properly.

## Usage

To manage email templates, navigate to the "Email Templates" tab in the main menu of the admin panel. Here, you'll find a list of all available email templates.

### Activating/Deactivating Templates

All templates are activated by default. If you wish to temporarily stop any of them, deactivate the toggler.

### Editing Templates

Click the "Edit" option next to the desired template. This opens the template editor powered by Unlayer, allowing you to customize the template according to your requirements. Make your changes, save, and the modified template will be applied to future email communications.

Now, your customized email templates will be utilized when sending emails from your Spree store.
